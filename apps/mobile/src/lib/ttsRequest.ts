/**
 * What a press of a speak button should do.
 *
 * The reader's Listen button used to branch on one boolean — "is something
 * playing" — and stop whenever it was true. That is right for the button that
 * started the sound and wrong for every other one. A reader who tapped a word,
 * heard it, then selected a sentence and pressed Listen got silence: the press
 * was read as "stop the word", and only a second press started the sentence.
 * Whether a press means stop or start depends on *which* text is playing, not
 * on whether anything is.
 *
 * The other half is the gap before sound. Fetching the audio takes about a
 * second on a first play, and nothing on screen said so, so the natural second
 * press landed while the first was still downloading — and cancelled it. That
 * is why a `loading` phase exists here rather than being folded into `idle`:
 * the UI has to be able to show that the press registered.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — the reader's speech path can only be exercised on a device,
 * so the part that decides is kept where a test can reach it.
